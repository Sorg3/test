    <h3>Achievements:</h3> 
      <ul>
        <em>
        <li>Sorge was German, but worked for Russians comunists.</li>
        <li>Even if he was appointined as comunist in Germany, he wasn't identified as it by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism">Nazis</a>.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>First of all, there was a change (big one) in German government which of course creates some confusion</li>
            <li>Second, when the Nazis got power, the burocracy took time to get in regime, making his comunist definition far to be exploited</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Sorge was that kind of guy which everybody loved: friends, girlfriends, unknownn people.</li>
        <li>He was indeed an hard alcoholic. His addiction cause him problems like a car crash in Japan which risked his covering.</li>
